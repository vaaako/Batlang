- Better error messages
- Unary Nodes don't print
- Replace EvalError
	+ To fix this I have to think in another way to declare RTResult
- Replace LexerError
	+ I don't remember why I didn't use BasicResult

X Make members const
	+ Don't need to (for now)
X Nodes don't need to be pointers (is just easier)
	+ It's harder to fix
