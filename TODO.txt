"-" - Problem
"+" - Note
"=>" - Solution to the problem above
```

-- NOTES --
- I think I will need to re-code all the logic to avoid using "optional"
	+ This happened because I usually uses null (because is easier), but C++ don't like null
	+ It won't be that complicated, but it will take time
	+ I think I'm going to do this after v1.0

-- Actual TODO --
- Comment
- Better error messages
- When jumping line make something to interpreter each line instead of a "single big line"
- Replace EvalError
	+ To fix this I have to think in another way to declare RTResult
	+ Fix circular import
- Replace LexerError
	+ I don't remember why I didn't use BasicResult

//- Add generics to Token = Token<TokenType::INT>(123, pos);
	+ Not necessary yet
X Make members const
	=> Don't need to (for now)
X Nodes don't need to be pointers (is just easier)
	=> It's harder to fix

X Unary Nodes don't print
	+ I don't know why this is happening
	+ node.hpp:85
	+ For some reason the expression "(N OP N) OP N" gives the same error
X 3 + 3 * (4 / 2) => free(): double free detected in tcache 2
	+ I don't know why
=> get_left() and get_right() was returnin "Node" I just changed to return "const Node&"
