"-" - Problem
"+" - Note
"=>" - Solution to the problem above
```

- Better error messages
- Replace EvalError
	+ To fix this I have to think in another way to declare RTResult
- Replace LexerError
	+ I don't remember why I didn't use BasicResult



X Make members const
	=> Don't need to (for now)
X Nodes don't need to be pointers (is just easier)
	=> It's harder to fix

X Unary Nodes don't print
	+ I don't know why this is happening
	+ node.hpp:85
	+ For some reason the expression "(N OP N) OP N" gives the same error
X 3 + 3 * (4 / 2) => free(): double free detected in tcache 2
	+ I don't know why
=> get_left() and get_right() was returnin "Node" I just changed to return "const Node&"
