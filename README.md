# Batlang ðŸ¦‡

Batlang is my Hobby Programming language, making just for learning and fun.
 It is called Batlang because bat ðŸ¦‡ is my favorite animal and *BAT* is in use alredy

>Batlang has no relation with BAT from Microsoft

# About
**Batlang** is a interpreted programming language with nothing new!

This is my **first project** with `Rust` and **I'm still learning**, so it *may contain some errors*

# Current State
**Batlang** is very early stage and isn't usable yet

## Features
- Tokenizer
- Lexer
- Error Handling
- Parser

## Objectives
- Simple
- Static typed
- Still uncertain about the syntax

# Running
```sh
cargo build
cargo run
```

## Why is the C++ version not the main version?
Because I hate `C++` from the bottom of my heart

# Credits
Made by me
